|-|-|
| ES2015+ | Not all ES2015+ features are supported. Run your code through a transpiler first such as [bubl√©](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buble) or [babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel). |
| Object.assign | Only supports two arguments currently. `Object.assign(a, b)` |
| AST | Not all declarations, expressions and statements have been implemented. More will be added as needed. |
